1.2
---

The key features and improvements in this release include:

  * Support for IPv6 clusters
  * New 'manager' privilege for volumes (allows granting/revoking access to
    other users)
  * New global quota mechanism for volume owners ('sxacl usermod --quota')
  * Support for cluster metadata ('sxadm cluster --(set|get|delete)-meta')
  * Improvements to the aes256 filter; now the default mode is to set the
    volume password during the first upload
  * Server side support for mass deletes and renames
  * Minor improvements and bugfixes

1.1
---

Skylable SX 1.1 brings many new features and improvements.
The major changes from 1.0 include:

  * All tools now work with passwords instead of authentication keys by
    default. The change is backward compatible: use --key to keep using
    the existing key or use 'sxacl usernewkey' to generate a new key based
    on a password. For security reasons, the automatically created admin
    account uses a random-generated key by default.
  * Faulty nodes can now be disabled without the immediate need to replace
    them ('sxadm cluster --set-faulty')
  * New garbage collector that improves speed of sxrm operations and supports
    nodes, which are temporarily separated from the cluster.
  * No new revision will be created on multi-revision volumes, if an
    overwritten file hasn't changed at all.
  * New tool 'sxdump' to automate cluster backup and recovery.
  * 'sxsetup --upgrade' to automatically upgrade cluster databases and
    storage to the latest format after updating the software.
  * 'sxinit --config-link' (use a configuration link for an automated setup)
  * 'sxinit --sxauthd' (use company credentials to access a cluster with SX
    Enterprise Edition extensions)
  * 'sxls --etag' (detect changes in volume contents)
  * 'sxadm node --check' improvements (now also requires cluster to be in
    read-only mode or a node to be offline)
  * 'sxadm cluster --set-mode' (set cluster to read-only mode and back)
  * 'sxinit --info' (display information about a configured profile)
  * 'sxadm cluster --list-nodes' (list all nodes and their configuration)
  * Performance improvements, including better sxls efficiency
  * Other improvements and bugfixes

1.0
---

This is the first stable release of Skylable SX. The changes
from 0.9 include:

  * New user manual covering all important cluster and
    client operations (see doc/manual/manual.pdf or 
    http://www.skylable.com/products/sx/manual)
  * Support for replacing and rebuilding of broken nodes (see
    the manual for instructions on cluster healing)
  * New tool 'sxmv' for moving and renaming files (see 'man sxmv')
  * 'sxcp --ignore-errors' (ignore errors during recursive operations
    and report them at the end)
  * 'sxcp --exclude/--include' (skip or process files matching specific
    patterns)
  * 'sxvol modify' (change configuration of existing volumes)
  * 'sxadm --resize' (proportionally grow or shrink the entire cluster)
  * 'sxadm node --check' improvements (better detect local problems,
    eg. with faulty hard drives)
  * 'sxadm node --extract' (recover local storage in emergency situations)
  * Many improvements and bugfixes

0.9 (Final Beta)
----------------

This is a final beta of Skylable SX! Changes in this release include:

  * New garbage collector implementation, both more robust and scalable
  * Full support for file revisions (see 'man sxrev' and 'man sxvol' for
    details on how to manage and work with the revisions)
  * "undelete" filter (see 'sxvol filter --info undelete')
  * Usability improvements, including new man pages for the client tools
  * Many minor improvements and bugfixes

0.4 (Fourth Beta)
-----------------

This release contains important enhancements and bugfixes, including:

  * Automatic rebalance when nodes are added, modified or removed
    from the cluster
  * aes256 filter now uses the AES-256-CBC-HMAC-512 mode and bcrypt for
    key derivation
  * sxcp --one-file-system support (to not cross filesystem boundaries)
  * sxcp can now limit the number of connections (global and per host), see
    --full-help for usage information
  * Many usability enhancements in the client tools
  * Other improvements and bugfixes

0.3 (Third Beta)
----------------

The key features and improvements in this release include:

  * Support for using a custom port number (configure with sxsetup --advanced).
    This also allows sxsetup to run without root privileges when SX is
    configured to run on a port higher than 1024.
  * sxcp now displays a progress bar while transferring files
  * sxcp --bwlimit support (to set a bandwidth usage limit)
  * configure --with-system-libs support (to force the use of system libraries
    instead of those bundled in 3rdparty/)
  * Many minor improvements and bugfixes

0.2 (Second Beta)
-----------------

Changes in this release include:

  * Support for building with either NSS or OpenSSL
  * Minimum Curl version supported is now 7.34.0 (configure will use the
    embedded version if the system's one is not supported - this allows
    out-of-box build on CentOS 6)
  * aes256 filter now generates per-volume salts; in order to preserve
    deduplication support across different volumes using the same password
    you can force a static salt, eg. --filter aes256="salt:af6a812ad0b1cb22"
  * sxinit --force-reinit support (to recreate the entire local cluster config)
  * sxinit --list support (to list all configured clusters and profiles)
  * sxinit --alias support (to assign an alias for easy access), see
    https://wiki.skylable.com/wiki/Sxinit#Aliases
  * sxls -l now also lists filters used by volumes
  * Other bugfixes and improvements

0.1 (First Beta)
----------------

Initial public release of Skylable SX.
