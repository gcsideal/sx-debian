\section{Bug reporting}
If you believe you've found a bug in \SX please enter it into
our Bugzilla tracker at \url{https://bugzilla.skylable.com}.
Please try to provide as much details as possible. If you
report a problem with the client, you can generate a report about
the system and client configuration by running:
\begin{lstlisting}
$ sxreport-client
Report stored in sxreport-client-1418047578.log
You can attach it to a bugreport at https://bugzilla.skylable.com
\end{lstlisting}
When reporting a problem with one of the server components, you can
use \path{sxreport-server} instead:
\begin{lstlisting}
# sxreport-server --anonymize
Anonymized report stored in sxreport-server-1418047910-anon.log
You can attach it to a bugreport at https://bugzilla.skylable.com
\end{lstlisting}
It creates a report with all IP addresses, URLs, and usernames
anonymized.
