.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sxacl userclone
\fR[\fI\,OPTIONS\/\fR] \fI\,<username> <clonename> sx://\/\fR[\fI\,profile@\/\fR]\fI\,cluster\/\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsxacl userclone\fR creates a clone of an existing user, which has the same type and privileges but a different authentication key. The clones can be used to access the same account from different devices to eliminate the need of changing the keys on all of them, in case one gets lost or compromised.
