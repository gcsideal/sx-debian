Skylable SX Quickstart
----------------------

This is a quick start guide for Skylable SX, which covers a basic
cluster setup with one node. For more information please see the
complete user manual available under doc/manual/manual.pdf and online
at http://www.skylable.com/products/sx/manual

1. Install SX
-------------

Install SX using binary packages available at
http://www.skylable.com/download/ or compile from source code
by running:

$ ./configure && make
# make install

2. Setup the first node
-----------------------

Run 'sxsetup' and provide a cluster name ("NAME"), an IP address and size
of the first node. When sxsetup finishes, you should see the following
information: "Congratulations, the new node is up and running!", now
you can move on to the next step - your cluster is already functional.

3. Create a regular user account
--------------------------------

sxsetup configures the default admin profile admin@NAME, which can be
used to perform administrative ops. We will use it to create a regular
user account 'jeff':

# sxacl useradd jeff sx://admin@NAME
Enter password for user 'jeff'
Enter password:
Re-enter password:
User successfully created!
Name: jeff
Key : FqmlTd9CWZUuPBGMdjE46DaT1/3kx+EYbahlrhcdVpy/9ePfrtWCIgAA
Type: normal

Now we initialize access for user jeff - you can do this from
a remote box, as long as the SX tools are installed and it can
reach the cluster. If NAME is not a domain name, we need to point
sxinit to the node by its IP address:

$ sxinit --host-list IP --alias @jeff sx://jeff@NAME
[verify and accept the SSL certificate]
Enter password:

You can now access the cluster with the alias @jeff or the full
profile name sx://jeff@NAME

3. Create a volume for user 'jeff'
----------------------------------

Run the following command as admin to create a 50GB volume for user jeff:

# sxvol create -o jeff -r 1 -s 50G sx://admin@NAME/somevolume

4. Upload data
--------------

To recursively upload a directory run:

$ sxcp -r /path/to/dir/ @jeff/somevolume/

To list all files in the volume run:

$ sxls -r @jeff/somevolume/

See 'man sxcp' and 'man sxls' for usage details.

5. Check the real manual
------------------------
